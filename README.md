# The Apprentice Engineer

This is a <b>blog site</b> that I'm developing to convey my thoughts and opinions about working as a <b>software engineering apprentice</b>.

It is currently built using `Flask` and `SQLite` in <b>Python</b>, as well as some vanilla <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b>.

## Development

Regular updates will be added as I continue development.
