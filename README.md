# The Apprentice Engineer

This is a <b>blog site</b> that I'm developing to convey my thoughts and opinions about working as a <b>software engineering apprentice</b>.

It is currently built using `Flask` and `SQLite` in <b>Python</b>, as well as some vanilla <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b>.

## Development Timeline

- `21/04/2025` Created a simple landing page design, using my terminal colour scheme as inspiration.

- `23/04/2025` Created a template for viewing individual blog posts.

- `28/04/2025` Added functionality to write posts and insert them into the database.

- `05/04/2025` Added functionality to edit posts and update the database with new content.
