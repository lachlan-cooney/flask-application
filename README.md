# The Apprentice Engineer

This is a <b>blog site</b> that I'm developing to convey my thoughts and opinions about working as a <b>software engineering apprentice</b>.

It is currently built using `Flask` and `SQLite` in <b>Python</b>, as well as some vanilla <b>CSS</b> and <b>HTML</b>.

## Development Timeline

> 21/04/2025

After a few days of development, I had created a basic landing/index page for the site. It's very basic, I know, but I wanted to replicate the simplicity and colour scheme of my Linux terminal:<br/>

The basic design is as follows:

* The background colour is `#171421`, which matches the `GNOME dark` theme on my terminal.

* I used `#26A269` for the header text and `#E9AD0C` for the footer text, which helps to differentiate between the elements on the page without changing their respective background colours.

* I used tilde symbol (`~`) to represent links, I think looks cleaner than underlines.

* Headings have a weight of `900` and everything else has a weight of `400`.

* The font I ended up choosing was `Space Mono`.

Over the next few days, I plan to finalise the database and table design, and create a page template for viewing a single post.
